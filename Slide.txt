React is a library created by facebook, used for building interfaces, fron-end applications

Some concepts in react include
- Components
- State
- Props
- Lifecycle 
- Events

COMPONENTS
    Components are like all the "sections" of the application, that makes up the  application
    Example, a todo list app might have the search component, the todo list component, the todo component, and the addTodo component

STATE:
    State is an object with values that determines how a component renders and behaves e.g of object {boy: 5, girl: 3}
    We can also have an "application level" state by using a state manager like redux or context API

    An application level state is data that'll be used across multiple components, e.g a todo in a todo application

    e.g of a state 
    state = {
        title: "hello world"
        body: 'This is hello world"
    }


                    How do we actually get started?
By calling CREATE-REACT-app


                    Anatomy of a Component

- There are two types of components, 
    -Class Based Component
    -Function Based Components

We will be using a class based component mostly

        #Lets create a component named Post

        Class Post extends React.Component{
            state = {
                title : 'My todo',
                body : 'This is an example of a todo component' 
            }

            render() {
                return (
                    <div>

                        <h2> {this.state.title} </h2>
                        <p> {this.state.body} </h2>

                    </div>
                )
            }
        }

        #Lets start react
on you terminal window run
          npx create-react-app appName
          e.g
        $ npx create-react-app todo


# You might get an error message like operation not permitted on windows
There are two reasons why this might happen.

    - You are not running in an elevated cmd prompt.
    - You have spaces in your username or path npm is looking for cache. For eg. "c:\Users\Fname Lastname...."

For the first one you can try running npx create-react-app newapp in an elevated cmd prompt. (Launching cmd as admin)

For the second one you would have to replace the username on the path for npm config that has spaces with the alternative username windows generates which you can get by using the cmd DIR /X if you are in the location. "c:\Users\". After getting the alternative name you then run

npm config set cache "C:\Users\Firstname~1\AppData\Roaming\npm-cache" --global

where Firstname~1 is the alternative name you got from the DIR /X command. You should now be able to run npx create-react-app new-app with no errors.
