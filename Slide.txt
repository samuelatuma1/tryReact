React is a library created by facebook, used for buildong interfaces, fron-end applications

Some concepts in react include
- Components
- State
- Props
- Lifecycle 
- Events

COMPONENTS
    Components are like all the "sections" of the application, that makes up the  application
    Example, a todo list app might have the search component, the todo list component, the todo component, and the addTodo component

STATE:
    State is an object with values that determines how a component renders and behaves e.g of object {boy: 5, girl: 3}
    We can also have an "application level" state by using a state manager like redux or context API

    An application level state is data that'll be used across multiple components, e.g a todo in a todo application

    e.g of a state 
    state = {
        title: "hello world"
        body: 'This is hello world"
    }


                    How do we actually get started?
By calling CREATE-REACT-app


                    Anatomy of a Component

- There are two types of components, 
    -Class Based Component
    -Function Based Components

We will be using a class based component mostly

        #Lets create a component named Post

        Class Post extends React.Component{
            state = {
                title : 'My todo',
                body : 'This is an example of a todo component' 
            }

            render() {
                return (
                    <div>

                        <h2> {this.state.title} </h2>
                        <p> {this.state.body} </h2>

                    </div>
                )
            }
        }

        #Lets start react
